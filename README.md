# Education

This repository is a collection of all the source code and other computer science assignments I have done over my educational career.  
NOTE: None of this code is polished and some might not exhibit 100% functionality to their original intentions because they were all left exactly as they were upon submission for grading.  
NOTE: Some of the assignments (mostly earlier courses) were given with skeleton code (fill in the blanks) so portions of the code were written by professors or TA but the core functionality of each source code **listed in the README's** was written by me.
