Code compiled on Linux (mimi.cs.mcgill.ca)  
  
NOTE:  
	Code AND testfile.txt were written in a windows text editor and so have line endings CRLF  
	Program has been tested and functions for both CRLF and LF line ending testfile's.  
	I have taken Vybihal's solution for A1 HOWEVER his code had issues (segfaults, etc)  
	which I have removed most of but Piping the input of a testfile.txt behaves weirdly  
	still.
